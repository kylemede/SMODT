.. SMODT documentation master file

Welcome to the SMODT documentation!
===============================================================================

The Simple MCMC Orbit Determination Tool (SMODT) provides the user with the 
ability to perform orbital fitting to any combination of astrometry and/or
radial velocity data.  The two coding languages, Python and C++, are free to 
compile and very simple to understand should the user wish to make any changes 
or write there own scripts calling some of the SMODT toolbox functions.

Please consult the readme file to learn how to set-up and run SMODT.

If the user does not have the code, please email the author at 
kylemede@astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp to request a copy of the latest version.  Any 
questions can also be directed to the author at the same address.

If SMODT is used to get results that will be published, please cite the ????
paper which introduced it to the astronomical community.
