# Further settings to properly set up RV part of simulations.
# RULES: -If using 3D, the RV data must be of the same companion as the DI data.
#	 -If RV calculations for a two companion system are needed 
#	  (ie. Primary star, secondary star AND planet around primary star)
#	  a complete set of orbital parameters for the companion that 
#         is NOT being simulated (ie. not the companion that the RV data is for)
#	  must be provided so it can be properly included in residual velocity calculations.
#	  This is common when investingating a secondary star's orbit in 3D and a planet
#	  exists around the primary as well.
